Question 1:
The following is the contents of the python file “student.py”:

class Student:
     def __init__(self, name, number, program):
         programs = ['CNS', 'CTY']
         self.name = name
         self.number = number
         self.courses = {}
         if program in programs:
             self.program = program
         else:
             self.program = 'unknown'

     def displayStudent(self):
         result = 'Student: '
         result += self.name
         result += '\n'
         result += 'Student ID: '
         result += self.number
         return result
         
Update the Class definition of Student in “student.py” with the minimal changes so that the python codes on the left in the table when executed will produce the result as shown on the right in the table:
Python code
Output
import student
ray = student.Student('David','0987654321','CTY')
print(ray.displayStudent())

Name: David
ID No: 0987654321
Program: CTY

Question 2:
Consider the class definition in the python file called “employee.py” :

class Prof:
     def __init__(self, name, eid, campus)
         self.name = name
         self.id = eid
         sites = ['Newnham', 'King', 'Seneca@York', 'Markham', 'Peterborough']
         if campus in sites:
               self.campus = campus
         else:
               self.campus = 'Seneca'
               
(a) There is a single coding error in the python file, please fix it.
(b) Add a class method called “displayInfo()” to the Prof class to display the name, id, campus location for all Prof object in the following format:
Professor Name: xxxxxxx
Employee ID: xxxxx
Campus: xxxxx
After the above two updates to the python file “employee.py”, the python codes on the left in the table when executed, it should produce the output shown on the right in the following table:
Python code
Output

import employee
prof = employee.Prof('Raymond','1234','York')
print(prof.displayInfo())


Professor Name: Raymond
Employee ID: 1234
Campus: Seneca
