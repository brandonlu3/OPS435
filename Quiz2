Question 1:
Write a function called average() to calculate and return the average of a list of numbers. The function should take a list of numbers as its only argument and return the average value of all the numbers in the list. 

Please use the following template for your python script to define the average() function and name it as q2.py. Replace [student_id] with your Seneca email user name. You are allowed to use any built-in functions in the average() function.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
'''Name: [student_id]
'''

def average(int_list):
   '''Calculate and return the average of a list'''
    avg = 0
    ###
    [insert your code for the function here]
    ###
    return avg

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a_list = [40, 3, 4, 12, 11]
    print('Average of',a_list,'is',average(a_list))
    b_list = [20, 5, 2, 6, 2]
    print('Average of',b_list,'is',average(b_list))
    c_list = [11, 21, 31]
    print('Average of',c_list,'is',average(c_list))
Sample run of the q2.py script:

[rchan@centos7 pq2]$ ./q2.py
Average of [40, 3, 4, 12, 11] is 14.0
Average of [20, 5, 2, 6, 2] is 7.0
Average of [11, 21, 31] is 21.0
Sample run with import under Python interactive shell:

[rchan@centos7 pq2]$ python3
>>> import q2
>>> my_list = [12, 22, 32]
>>> print(q2.average(my_list))
22.0


Question 2:
Consider the following Python function h2i() :

def h2i(obj):
        source = str(obj).lower()
        temp = '0'
        target = '0123456789abcdef'
        for c in source:
            if c in target:
               temp = temp + c
        result = int(temp,16)
        return result

What type of object will be returned by the function h2i() if there are no runtime errors?


Question 3:
Consider the following Python function h2i() :

def h2i(obj):
        source = str(obj).lower()
        temp = '0'
        target = '0123456789abcdef'
        for c in source:
            if c in target:
               temp = temp + c
        result = int(temp,16)
        return result

If the string 'abcd' is passed as the function argument to the function h2i(), what would the contents of object c be right after the for loop?


Question 4:
Consider the following Python function h2i() :

def h2i(obj):
        source = str(obj).lower()
        temp = '0'
        target = '0123456789abcdef'
        for c in source:
            if c in target:
               temp = temp + c
        result = int(temp,16)
        return result

What is the purpose of the for loop in the function h2i()?


Question 5:
Consider the following Python function h2i() :

def h2i(obj):
        source = str(obj).lower()
        temp = '0'
        target = '0123456789abcdef'
        for c in source:
            if c in target:
               temp = temp + c
        result = int(temp,16)
        return result

What will be returned when the function h2i() is called with string object 'F'?


Question 6:
Consider the following Python function h2i() :

def h2i(obj):
        source = str(obj).lower()
        temp = '0'
        target = '0123456789abcdef'
        for c in source:
            if c in target:
               temp = temp + c
        result = int(temp,16)
        return result

What will be returned when the function h2i() is called with a list object ['10, The Pond Road', 'Toronto']?
